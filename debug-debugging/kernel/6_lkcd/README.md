## Introduction  to CrashDump/CoreDump:

Whenever an application crashes, the operating system can store (or even send) a crash report.
On Linux, whenever an app crashes (most commonly by a segmentation fault, i.e. when accessing a bad pointer/memory), it has the option of generating a core dump.

A core dump is a file containing a process's address space (memory) when the process terminates unexpectedly. 
Core dumps may be produced on-demand (such as by a debugger), or automatically upon termination. 
Core dumps are triggered by the kernel in response to program crashes, and may be passed to a helper program (such as systemd-coredump) for further processing. 

We can use the core dump to diagnose and debug our computer programs by loading the core file into a debugger along with the executable file (for symbols and other debugging information). 

## What Information coredump contain:
It also contains a snapshot of all the virtual memory areas accessed by your app, so yes, there can be confidential information stored in a core dump so be careful who you give it to.

## Coredump @ userspace

### How to enable coredump:

You can check whether core dump files are enabled with the following command:
	$ ulimit -c

By default core dump files are disabled, in which case this command will return 0. To enable core dump files, use the following command:
	$ ulimit -c unlimited

	$ ls -la /proc/sys/kernel/core*
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 Aug 28 23:53 core_pattern
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 Aug 28 16:12 core_pipe_limit
	-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 Aug 28 23:53 core_uses_pid

	$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
	|/usr/libexec/abrt-hook-ccpp %s %c %p %u %g %t e

Note that the first character of the pattern is a "|", the kernel will treat the rest of the pattern as a command to run. The core dump will be written to the standard input of that program instead of to a file.

We need to change the line of the core_pattern to "core".
	$ sudo bash -c 'echo core.%e.%p > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern'
	$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
	core.%e.%p

In the setting, %e is for executable file name and %p is for pid.

	$ gcc -g error.c -o error
	$ ulimit -c unlimited
	$ ./error
	Segmentation fault (core dumped)
	$ ls
	core.error.3209 error error.c
   
### Analyzing Core File:

	$ gdb <executable> <core-file>

	$ gdb ./error core.error.4981
	GNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.7.1-0ubuntu5~14.04.3) 7.7.1
	[New LWP 4981]
	Core was generated by `./error'.
	Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
	#0  0x00000000004004fd in fun () at error.c:5
	5	    *ptr = 7;
	(gdb) 

It indicates the line 5 has an issue.
We can use backtrace to list the call stacks that had been made when the program crashed:
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00000000004004fd in fun () at error.c:5
#1  0x0000000000400513 in main () at error.c:10
(gdb) up
#1  0x0000000000400513 in main () at error.c:10
10	    fun();
(gdb) down
#0  0x00000000004004fd in fun () at error.c:5
5	    *ptr = 7;


## Coredump @ Kernelspace

Using kdump and kexec analyze the kernel coredump files.

### kexec:

kexec is directly boot into a new kernel without going through BIOS.
Kexec is a fastboot mechanism that allows booting a Linux kernel from the context of an already running kernel without going through BIOS. 
BIOS can be very time consuming, especially on big servers with numerous peripherals. 
This can save a lot of time for developers who end up booting a machine numerous times
kexec is a system call that enables you to load and boot into another kernel from the currently running  kernel.
kexec performs the function of the boot loader from within the kernel. The primary difference between a standard system boot and a kexec boot is that the hardware initialization normally performed  by  the  BIOS  or  firmware (depending  on  architecture)  is  not  performed  during a kexec boot. 
This has the effect of reducing the time required for a reboot

### kdump:

Kdump is a new kernel crash dumping mechanism and is very reliable. 
The crash dump is captured from the context of a freshly booted kernel and not from the context of the crashed kernel. 
Kdump uses Kexec to boot into a second kernel whenever the system crashes. 
This second kernel, often called a crash or a capture kernel, boots with very little memory and captures the dump image.
The first kernel reserves a section of memory that the second kernel uses to boot. 
Kexec enables booting the capture kernel without going through BIOS hence the contents of the first kernel’s memory are preserved, which is essentially the kernel crash dump.

kdump is a feature of the Linux kernel that creates crash dumps in the event of a kernel crash. When triggered, kdump exports a memory image (also known as vmcore) that can be analyzed for the purposes of debugging and determining the cause of a crash.


### Enable the below kernel configuration options & compile:

#### System kernel config options:

1) Enable "kexec system call" in "Processor type and features."
This parameter tells the system to use Kexec to skip BIOS and boot (new) kernels. It is critical for the functionality of Kdump.
   CONFIG_KEXEC=y

2) Enable "sysfs file system support" in "Filesystem" -> "Pseudo
   filesystems." This is usually enabled by default
   CONFIG_SYSFS=y

3) Enable "Compile the kernel with debug info" in "Kernel hacking."
   This causes the kernel to be built with debug symbols. The dump analysis tools require a vmlinux with debug symbols in order to read and analyze a dump file
   CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y

#### Dump-capture kernel config options (Arch Independent):

1) Enable kernel crash dumps: Crash dumps need to be enabled. Without this option, Kdump will be useless.
   CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP=y

2) Enable "/proc/vmcore support" under "Filesystems" -> "Pseudo filesystems".
   CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE=y
   (CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE is set by default when CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP is selected.)

#### Dump-capture kernel config options (Arch Dependent, i386 and x86_64)

1) If one wants to build and use a relocatable kernel,
   Enable "Build a relocatable kernel" support under "Processor type and
   features"
   CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y

2) Optional: Disable Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) support: Kdump can only work with a single processor. 
If you have only a single processor or you run your machine with SMP support disabled, you can safely set this parameter to (n).
   CONFIG_SMP=n
   KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND="maxcpus=1"
(If CONFIG_SMP=y, then specify maxcpus=1 on the kernel command line when loading the dump-capture kernel, see section "Load the Dump-capture Kernel".)

3) Use a suitable value for "Physical address where the kernel is loaded" (under "Processor type and features"). 
   This only appears when "kernel crash dumps" is enabled. A suitable value depends upon whether kernel is relocatable or not.

   If you are using a relocatable kernel use CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x100000
   This will compile the kernel for physical address 1MB, but given the fact kernel is relocatable, it can be run from any physical address hence kexec boot loader will load it in memory region reserved for dump-capture kernel.

Otherwise it should be the start of memory region reserved for second kernel using boot parameter "crashkernel=Y@X". 
Here X is start of memory region reserved for dump-capture kernel.
   Generally X is 16MB (0x1000000). So you can set CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x1000000

5) Make and install the kernel and its modules.

#### Dump-capture kernel config options (Arch Dependent, arm)

1)  To use a relocatable kernel,
    Enable "AUTO_ZRELADDR" support under "Boot" options:
    AUTO_ZRELADDR=y

#### Install Kdump & Kexec:

$ sudo apt-get install linux-crashdump

#### crash kernel recommendations:

For memory between 2G through 4G, reserve 320M
For memory between 4G through 32G, reserve 512M
For memory between 32G through 64G, reserve 1024M
For memory between 64G through 128G, reserve 2048M
For memory above 128G, reserve 4096M

add "crashkernel=256M" in /boot/grub/grub.cfg file.

#### Example:

Command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-4.4.88 root=UUID=aab9b05c-202b-42c6-8be6-c90e9d6af8e8 ro quiet splash crashkernel=256M vt.handoff=7

	$ kdump-config status
	$ kdump-config show
	$ kdump-config load
	$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
	$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.sysrq=1
