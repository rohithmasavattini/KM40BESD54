## bitbake commands

https://elinux.org/Bitbake_Cheat_Sheet

##### the below command shows list the pre-defined Yocto images in all meta files, run the following command from your poky directory

    $ cd poky-zeus-bbb
    $ find . -type f -path '*images/*' -name '*.bb'
    $ bitbake-layers show-recipes "*image*"

##### list of tasks

    $ bitbake <image-name>  -c "listtasks"

##### bitbake version
    
    $ bitbake --version

##### Execute particular task

    $ bitbake -c compile <package_name> (do_compile - Compiles the source in the compilation directory)
    $ bitbake -c clean <package_name> (do_clean - Removes all output files for a target)
    $ bitbake -c clean -f <package_name> (do_clean - Removes all output files for a target with force)
    $ bitbake -c cleanall -f <package_name> (do_cleanall - Removes all output files, shared state cache, and downloaded source files for a target)
    $ bitbake -c cleansstate <package name> (do_cleansstate - Removes all output files and shared state cache for a target)

##### You can get a list of locally available packages and their current version with:

    $ bitbake -s

##### Build particular package (do_patch, do_metadata, do_compile)

    $ bitbake <package name>

##### Build package source level 
"devshell" a convenient way to try with some source or inpackage level changes and tryout. 
It does open a new shell at the package location. Where you can give the commands locally. As simple as make.

    $ bitbake <package name> -c devshell

##### You can just simply fetch the source code, no other tasks are going to be executed

    $ bitbake -c fetch -f <package_name>

#### Yocto maintains packages information in a form of manifest file located in 

    /tmp/deploy/images/<"machine_image">/<"image_name">.manifest.

##### You can easily list all the targets/recipes (.bb files) in your workspace doing:

    $ bitbake-layers show-recipes

##### If you want only the recipes for your image, do:

    $ bitbake-layers show-recipes "<image_name>"
