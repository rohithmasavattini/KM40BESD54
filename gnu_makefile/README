Advantages:
-----------

-----------------
source files: main.c,add.c,sub.c
header files: myinclude.h

Example 1: This is Basic example of Makefile.
---------
$ make
default target is all

Example 2: This example shows how to use,  clean and install targets, in Makefile.
---------
$ make clean (This command cleans object files, binaries and configuration files)
$ make install  (This command copy the binaries in /usr/bin directory)


Example 3: This Example shows how to use environment variables in Makefile
---------

Example 4: This Example shows how to create multiple Makefiles in each directory.
----------

Example 5: This Example shows how to give user defined name to Makefile.
